description: >-
  We delivered a resheeting job in Darlington, which seen our team remove the
  damaged existing sheeting on a grainstore and install our new anti-con Roof
  Sheets. 

  The project was completed before 2025 Harvest, which enabled the grainstore to have improved weatherproofing, durability and longevity.
