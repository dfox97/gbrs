description: >-
  We supplied and fitted a brand new 40mm composite roof for and industrial
  client. The project included removing the old, damaged existing roof cladding,
  and replacing it with new. The team did the project in sections, allowing work
  to continue as normal below, letting minimal amounts of rain inside the
  building during the project. 

  Also, we stripped existing leaking and rotten steel gutters out, and replace with new sections of galvisend gutter (were needed) and supplied and installed a Plygene gutter liners. 

  Here are aerial views of the multi‑span industrial warehouses re‑roofed with Goosewing grey 40mm Composite sheets and new translucent rooflights.
